Challenges we ran into
Challenges We Ran Into

Mapping Unique Base Names to Wallets
Challenge: Developing a robust system to ensure each Base name is unique and securely linked to a userâ€™s wallet.
Solution: Implemented a blockchain-backed name registry with smart contracts that validate and store Base names while preventing duplication.
Balancing Privacy and Discoverability
Challenge: Allowing users to be easily discoverable without exposing sensitive information.
Solution: Introduced privacy-preserving mechanisms, ensuring only the Base name is publicly visible while other data remains encrypted or hidden.
Integration with Decentralized Identity Standards
Challenge: Ensuring interoperability with existing decentralized identity solutions.
Solution: Adopted open standards like DID (Decentralized Identifiers) to enhance compatibility across Web3 ecosystems.
Onboarding Non-Web3 Users
Challenge: Simplifying the onboarding process for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology.
Solution: Designed an intuitive UI/UX with clear instructions and integrated guides to help users create Base names easily.
Through constant iteration, collaboration, and community feedback, we successfully overcame these challenges to build a user-centric solution.
